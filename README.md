# SK--
Repository for the programming language SK++ developed by Sourish Tilwankar and Kriday Lalwani

## Intro to SK++
SK++ was developed by two 14 year old wannabe devs in their free time instead of actually studying. <br>
This is just a personal project for now, but might be scaled to be a real language one day. <br>
## Basic Syntax
### Declaring our main method/function:
```
run main() {

}
```
you can use the keyword **'run'** to define a function.

### Hello, World! program
```
run main() {
  write("Hello, World!");
}
```
