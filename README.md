# SK--
Repository for the programming language SK++ developed by Sourish Tilwankar and Kriday Lalwani
<br>
## Intro to SK++
SK++ was developed by two 14 year old wannabe devs in their free time instead of actually studying. <br>
This is just a personal project for now, but might be scaled to be a real language one day. <br>
## Basic Syntax
### Declaring our main method/function:
```
run main() {

}
```
you can use the keyword **'run'** to define a function.
<br>
### Hello, World! program
```
run main() {
  write("Hello, World!");
}
```
you can use the *write();* function to print to the standard output.
<br>
### Datatypes in SK++
Currently, there are four datatypes in SK++ being:
1. **num** - the number data-type, also known as int in other languages.
2. **txt** - the text data-type, also known as string in other languages.
3. **dec** - the decimal data-type, also known as float in other languages.
4. **binary** - the binary data-type, also known as boolean in other languages.
<br>
### declaring variables
To declare a variable, type the datatype followed by the variable's name, '=' symbol and then its value.
```
<datatype> variable_name = <value>
```
<br>
Examples:
```
num age = 14;
txt language = "SK++";
dec PI = 3.14;
binary isCool = true
```
